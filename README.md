# markdown-resume

My resume in Markdown and styled with CSS. Feel free to clone and use as a template!

The template is from Teng-Jui Lin's [markdown-resume](https://github.com/tengjuilin/markdown-resume), and I exported the Markdown file to PDF using  [Markdown PDF Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tom-latham.markdown-pdf-plus).
